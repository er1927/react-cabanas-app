<!-- 

This is a revamped version of an HTML5/CSS/JS website I created for a local cabin rental,
that you can check out here: https://github.com/er1927/cabanas-iris

I switched from multi-page to single page to improve ease of use & customer engagement, and
I included a react component for the image gallery display to improve speed & functionality.

This was my first solo project using React, and I'm quite pleased with the results, simple as they might be.

Thanks for reading!
