<!-- 
App's purpose:
    This is a revamped version of an HTML5/CSS/JS website I created for a local cabin rental,
    that you can check out here: https://github.com/er1927/cabanas-iris
    It's a responsive one-page site that showcases the cabins available for rent, 
    alongside directions on how to get to their location,
    and contact information to reach out to the owners.

App's functionality:
    You can navigate the site via the nav bar up top,
    you can slide through the image galleries for each cabin,
    you can access the embeded Google map to get directions
    and read the Google reviews.

Additional dependencies installed:
    "react-image-gallery": "^1.2.11",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "react-slick": "^0.29.0",
    "slick-carousel": "^1.8.1",

Deploy instructions:
